## About myself:
At the moment I am an 18-year-old student of MSLU.
I study at the English Faculty. After 2 years of study, I realized that this is not what I want to do and found a more interesting area for myself - **web development**. At the moment I am doing everything possible to become a **qualified specialist** in this field.

## Skills:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Fundamentals)
- Git/GitHub

## Code Example:

    function testWhile(a) {
    var x = 1;
    var sum = 0;                
    while(x <= a)
    {
        
        if (x % 2 === 0) {
            sum = x + sum;
        }
        x++;
        }
          
            return sum;
    }
